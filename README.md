# Project-EDA_Global-Terrorism-Dataset
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project on the Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD). 

About the dataset:
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database containing information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. This dataset currently has 181,691 rows and 135 columns.
Source :- The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

This dataset contains a wide range of information, however, for this project, data has been analyzed on the basis of countries attacked, number of terrorist attacks over the years, weapons used, gangs involved, types of attacks, attack targets, suicide attacks and intention of attacks.

The EDA Processes include loading the dataset, data cleaning, and data visualization.

Objective: The objective of this EDA project is to understand the various aspects of terrorist attacks around the globe including countries affected, weapons used, gangs involved, attack types and targets. This information can be used by Goverments and International Organizations to come together and formulate policies to curb these activities and ensure world peace, safety and security. 

Challenges: This dataset has a lot of missing values which limit analysis in many areas. Moreover, the data covers the period from 1970 to 2017. The current year being 2023, we would need the data for the period from 2018 to 2023 for understanding the current position of global terrorist attacks since many socio-economic-political changes have taken place over the recent years. Having said that, this dataset is still quite useful in providing intriguing insights on global terrorism.
